Object Utilities for NoFlo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-objects.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-objects)
===============================

This package provides utility components to manipulate objects in
[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/).

An object in this context isn't an object in the sense of OOP, but in
the sense of a native JavaScript object, or basically a hash/dictionary.
These components let you manipulate them as IPs in NoFlo.

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
