# noflo-adapters [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-adapters.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/noflo/noflo-adapters)

This package provides various components to convert packets from one
format to another in [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/).

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
