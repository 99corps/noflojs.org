Packet Utilities for NoFlo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-packets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-packets)
===============================

This package provides utility components to manipulate packets and
connections in [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/).

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
