Group Utilities for NoFlo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-groups.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-groups)
===============================

This package provides utility components to manipulate groups in
[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/).

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
