Routing Packets in NoFlo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-routers.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kenhkan/noflo-routers)
===============================

Whenever you want to forward an IP to a particular process downstream
but not other based on some criteria, you need a router. This is a
collection of routers for NoFlo.

Feel free to contribute new components and graphs! I'll try to
incorporate as soon as time allows.
