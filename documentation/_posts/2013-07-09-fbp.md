title: Language for Flow-Based Programming

In addition to the JSON format described above, FBP has its own Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for easy graph definition. The syntax is the following:

* `'somedata' -> PORT Process(Component)` sends initial data _somedata_ to port _PORT_ of process _Process_ that runs component _Component_
* `A(Component1) X -> Y B(Component2)` sets up a connection between port _X_ of process _A_ that runs component _Component1_ and port _Y_ of process _B_ that runs component _Component2_

You can connect multiple components and ports together on one line, and separate connection definitions with a newline or a comma (`,`). 

Components only have to be specified the first time you mention a new process. Afterwards, simply append empty parentheses (`()`) after the process name.

Example:

```coffeescript
'somefile.txt' -> SOURCE Read(ReadFile) OUT -> IN Split(SplitStr)
Split() OUT -> IN Count(Counter) COUNT -> IN Display(Output)
Read() ERROR -> IN Display()
```

NoFlo supports the FBP language fully. You can either load a graph with a string of FBP-language commands with:

```coffeescript
fbpData = "<some FBP language connections>"
    
noflo = require "noflo"
noflo.graph.loadFbp fbpData, (graph) ->
  console.log "Graph loaded"
  console.log graph.toDOT()
```

The `.fbp` file suffix is used for files containing FBP language. This means you can load them also the same way as you load JSON files, using the `noflo.loadFile` method, or the NoFlo shell. Example:

    $ noflo examples/linecount/count.fbp
